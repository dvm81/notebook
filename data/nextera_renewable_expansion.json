  "document_title": "NextEra Energy: Renewable capacity expansion accelerates with record backlog of 24 GW",
  "document_content": "NextEra Energy reported Q4 2024 results and provided 2025-2027 growth outlook, highlighting aggressive renewable energy expansion plans. Adjusted EPS reached $0.98, in line with guidance, bringing full-year 2024 EPS to $3.35, up 10% year-over-year. The company announced record renewable energy backlog of approximately 24 gigawatts (GW), up from 18 GW a year ago, representing over $35 billion in capital deployment through 2027. Solar projects account for 14 GW, wind for 7 GW, and battery storage for 3 GW. NextEra Energy Resources (the competitive energy subsidiary) signed 4.2 GW of new power purchase agreements (PPAs) in Q4 alone, predominantly with technology companies seeking to power data centers and meet sustainability commitments. Key customers include Meta, Google, and Amazon Web Services, which collectively represent 40% of new contract volume. Average PPA duration is 15-20 years with inflation-linked pricing mechanisms, providing highly visible cash flows. Florida Power & Light (FP&L), the regulated utility subsidiary, continues to deliver steady earnings growth. The utility invested $3.8 billion in 2024 across grid modernization, storm hardening, and incremental solar buildout. FP&L now operates 2.2 GW of solar capacity in Florida, with plans to add 1.5 GW by 2026. Customer bills remain among the lowest in Florida despite significant infrastructure investment, supported by O&M efficiency gains and fuel diversity. The company affirmed long-term growth targets: adjusted EPS growth of 10% annually through 2027, with dividends growing proportionally. Capex guidance for 2025-2027 is $95-105 billion, heavily weighted toward renewables and battery storage. Financing plan includes $12-15 billion annual equity needs, to be met through DRIP, ATM programs, and employee plans without significant dilution. Key drivers include: (1) AI-driven data center electricity demand growing 15-20% annually; (2) corporate decarbonization commitments creating long-term offtake visibility; (3) Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits enhancing project returns by 200-300 bps; (4) battery storage economics improving as lithium costs decline. Risks include: interest rate sensitivity given capital intensity, policy uncertainty around IRA extension post-2032, permitting and interconnection delays, and weather/commodity price volatility. On ESG, NextEra remains the world's largest renewable energy generator, avoiding approximately 150 million tons of CO2 emissions annually.",
