  "document_content": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted unanimously to maintain the federal funds target range at 5.25%-5.50% at its November 2025 meeting, marking the fourth consecutive meeting at this level. The decision was widely anticipated by market participants. In the policy statement, the Committee acknowledged that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, with job gains remaining strong and the unemployment rate staying low at 3.7%. However, inflation remains elevated, with headline CPI at 3.2% YoY and core PCE at 3.7% YoY, both well above the Committee's 2% longer-run target. Chair Powell, in the post-meeting press conference, emphasized the Committee's data-dependent approach and noted that while progress has been made in reducing inflation, the process remains uneven and gradual. Powell highlighted that the labor market remains tight, with job openings still elevated and wage growth continuing at around 4% annually. He reiterated that the Committee is prepared to maintain rates at restrictive levels for an extended period to ensure inflation returns sustainably to the 2% target. Regarding the economic outlook, the updated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed: (1) median GDP growth forecast of 2.1% for 2025, unchanged from September; (2) unemployment rate projection of 4.1% by end-2025, up slightly from 3.8% in September; (3) core PCE inflation forecast of 2.6% for end-2025, revised up 0.2pp from September; and (4) the median \"dot\" for the federal funds rate at 5.1% for end-2025, implying only 50bps of cuts expected next year, down from 100bps in the September projection. Market implications: The hawkish hold and reduced rate cut expectations triggered immediate market reactions. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 12bps to 4.58%, the 2-year yield increased 15bps to 5.02%, and the S&P 500 declined 1.6%. The US dollar index strengthened 0.8% against major currencies. Powell pushed back on market speculation of rate cuts beginning in Q1 2026, stating that the Committee needs to see convincing evidence of sustained disinflation before considering policy adjustments. Key takeaways: The Fed's stance has clearly shifted more hawkish, with emphasis on keeping policy restrictive longer than previously anticipated. The upward revision to inflation forecasts and reduction in expected rate cuts signal the Committee's concern about inflation persistence. Powell's emphasis on data dependency suggests that upcoming inflation and employment reports will be critical in determining the timing of any policy pivot. For investors, this implies continued pressure on interest rate-sensitive sectors, potential headwinds for equity valuations, and support for the US dollar.",

  "generated_summary": "## Federal Reserve November FOMC: Hawkish Hold Extends Restrictive Policy Stance\n\n**Policy Decision:** The FOMC unanimously maintained the fed funds target range at 5.25%-5.50%, the fourth consecutive hold, in line with market expectations. The Committee's statement recognized solid economic expansion and robust job gains, but emphasized that inflation remains elevated significantly above the 2% target (headline CPI 3.2% YoY, core PCE 3.7% YoY).\n\n**Chair Powell's Key Messages:**\n- Reiterated data-dependent approach while stressing inflation progress has been uneven\n- Highlighted persistent labor market tightness (unemployment 3.7%, wage growth ~4% annually)\n- Emphasized commitment to maintaining restrictive policy for extended period until sustainable disinflation achieved\n- Pushed back firmly on market expectations for Q1 2026 rate cuts\n\n**Updated Economic Projections (SEP):**\n- GDP growth: 2.1% for 2025 (unchanged from September)\n- Unemployment: 4.1% by end-2025 (revised up from 3.8%)\n- Core PCE inflation: 2.6% for end-2025 (revised up 0.2pp)\n- Fed funds rate median dot: 5.1% for end-2025, implying only 50bps of cuts (down from 100bps in September)\n\n**Market Reaction:** Immediate hawkish repricing across assets - 10Y Treasury yield surged 12bps to 4.58%, 2Y yield rose 15bps to 5.02%, S&P 500 declined 1.6%, and USD strengthened 0.8%.\n\n**Investment Implications:** The Fed's notably more hawkish stance signals \"higher for longer\" rate environment. Reduced rate cut expectations (50bps vs 100bps) and upward inflation revisions underscore Committee concerns about inflation persistence. This backdrop suggests continued headwinds for rate-sensitive sectors and equity valuations, while supporting USD strength. Upcoming inflation and employment data will be critical for assessing policy pivot timing.",
