  "document_title": "NVIDIA Corporation: Q324 earnings beat driven by data center strength",
  "document_content": "NVIDIA reported Q3 FY2024 revenue of $18.12 billion, up 206% year-over-year, significantly exceeding Street expectations of $16.18 billion. Data Center revenue reached $14.51 billion, up 279% YoY, representing 80% of total revenue. The company's H100 and H200 GPUs remain in high demand from cloud service providers, enterprises, and sovereign AI initiatives. Gaming revenue was $2.86 billion (+81% YoY), Professional Visualization reached $416 million (+108% YoY), and Automotive generated $261 million (+4% YoY). Gross margin expanded to 75.0%, up from 53.6% a year ago, driven by premium AI accelerator pricing. Operating income reached $10.02 billion, with operating margin of 55.3%. Net income was $9.24 billion, up 593% YoY. Diluted EPS was $0.37, versus $0.05 in the prior year. For Q4 FY2024, NVIDIA guides revenue to approximately $20.0 billion ±2%, with gross margin expected around 74.5%. The company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share. CEO Jensen Huang noted that generative AI adoption has reached an inflection point, with enterprises across industries implementing AI computing infrastructure. The company highlighted strong demand for its Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform and announced partnerships with major cloud providers for next-generation AI services. Management emphasized continued investment in R&D for next-generation Blackwell architecture GPUs, expected to launch in 2024. Key growth drivers include: (1) expanding AI adoption across industries beyond technology, (2) sovereign AI initiatives in multiple countries, (3) growing demand for AI inference workloads, and (4) transition to accelerated computing architectures. Risks include potential supply chain constraints, competitive pressures from AMD and custom silicon, and geopolitical uncertainties affecting China sales.",
