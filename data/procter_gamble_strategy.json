  "document_content": "Procter & Gamble reported fiscal Q2 2025 results that beat earnings expectations while facing ongoing volume headwinds. Revenue reached $21.9 billion, up 2% organically, driven entirely by pricing/mix as volumes declined 1%. Core EPS grew 8% to $1.88, exceeding consensus of $1.83. The company's premiumization strategy continues to drive margin expansion, with gross margin improving 180 bps to 52.3% and operating margin up 140 bps to 24.1%. Beauty segment was the standout performer, growing 6% organically with SK-II in China rebounding strongly (+12% in Greater China) after pandemic-related softness. Olay benefited from successful Regenerist Retinol 24 launch. Fabric & Home Care grew 3%, led by Tide and Downy premium innovations. However, volumes declined 2% as consumers traded down to value brands amid persistent inflation. Baby Care faced challenges with 3% volume decline as birth rates continue falling in developed markets and competitive intensity increases in China. Diaper category declined mid-single digits globally. Grooming was flat, with Gillette stabilizing in developed markets but facing competition from direct-to-consumer brands. Health Care grew 4%, driven by Oral-B electric toothbrush innovation and Vicks cough/cold seasonal strength. Geographically, North America grew 1%, Western Europe up 2%, and developing markets up 4% with strong performance in India and Latin America. China remained challenging, growing only 1% as consumer confidence lags despite economic reopening. The company raised full-year guidance, now expecting organic sales growth of 3-4% (up from 2-4%) and core EPS growth of 10-12% (up from 8-10%). Management emphasized continued focus on premiumization, innovation velocity, and productivity savings. Cost savings program is on track to deliver $1.5 billion in fiscal 2025. Capital allocation priorities remain dividend growth (67-year track record) and opportunistic share buybacks, with $8-9 billion expected in fiscal 2025. Key investment considerations include sustainability of premium pricing power in recessionary environment, market share dynamics in key categories, and ability to reignite volume growth. Valuation at 24x forward P/E reflects quality premium but limits upside absent acceleration.",
